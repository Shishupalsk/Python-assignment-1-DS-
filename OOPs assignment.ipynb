    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Encapsulation: It involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation restricts access to some of an object's components and prevents the accidental modification of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential characteristics and ignoring unnecessary details. It provides a clear separation between what an object does and how it achieves that functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical structure in which a new class can be built upon an existing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. It enables a single interface to represent different types, and it can be achieved through method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) and method overriding (providing a specific implementation in the subclass).\n"
